# Online-Retail-Customer-Segementaion

In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all- occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing 
such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. Customer Segmentation is one the most 
important applications of unsupervised 
learning. Using clustering techniques, 
companies can identify the several segments 
of customers allowing them to target the 
potential user base. In this machine learning 
project, we will make use of K-Means 
clustering which is the essential algorithm 
for clustering unlabelled dataset.
